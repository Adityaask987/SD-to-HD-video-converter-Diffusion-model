# Video Inpainting using OpenCV
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates video inpainting using OpenCV.

# Description
The script reads a video file, applies inpainting to each frame, and writes the resulting video to a new file. Inpainting is a technique used to remove unwanted objects or defects from an image or video. In this example, we use the Telea algorithm to inpaint a region of the frame.

# How it Works
The script imports the necessary libraries: OpenCV (cv2) and NumPy (np).
It initializes a video writer object (hd_video) to write the output video to a file.
It reads a video file (sd_video) frame by frame using a while loop.
For each frame, it resizes the frame to a higher resolution (1280x720) using cubic interpolation.
It creates a mask image with zeros, and sets the left and right 160-pixel columns to 255 (white). This mask will be used to specify the region to be inpainted.
It applies the Telea inpainting algorithm to the resized frame using the mask.
It writes the inpainted frame to the output video file.
Finally, it releases the video capture and video writer objects.
# Usage
To use this script, simply replace output_video_path with the desired output file path, and sd_video with the input video file object.

# Note
This script assumes that the input video file is in the same directory as the script. You may need to modify the script to handle different file paths or video formats.
